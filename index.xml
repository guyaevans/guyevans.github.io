&lt;/div>After lucking out and not loosing any of my data saved to my nextcloud after the OVH fire. I started searching for a decent backup solution and found Restic, lets take a look at how it works.</description></item><item><title>Self-hosted Email - Why and How?</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2023-01-09_self-hosted-email-why-and-how/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 14:00:58 +0000</pubDate><author>Guy Evans</author><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2023-01-09_self-hosted-email-why-and-how/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>After the Virtual Private Servers After loosing one of my virtual private servers along with the data in the &lsquo;The Great Fire of OVH ðŸ”¥&rsquo;1 (Yes I know I should have had backups of that VPS2), I thought why not setup a Proxmox3 Cluster4 on a couple dedicated servers.
So I went ahead and found OneProvider.com where you can rent dedicated servers for cheap, their cheap hardware is old and the connectivity is ok but you cannot beat there pricing (Server with an Intel Atom C2750, 16 Gb Ram, 1Tb Hard drive and 1Gb of &lsquo;unlimited&rsquo; bandwidth was â‚¬14 per server/month at the time).]]></description></item><item><title>Podcast Recommendations</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-12-21_podcast-recommendations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 17:20:57 +0000</pubDate><author>Guy Evans</author><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-12-21_podcast-recommendations/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>So I know a couple people who run their ASNs on Mikrotik routers (running RouterOS) as their hardware is cheap and easy to find. That includes me, I run BGP on their CHR image to announce my own ASN and IP v4 and V6 subnets. RouterOS CHR which is an image of RouterOS that you can run on your own hardware.
You would prevously use RouterOS version 6, but now version 7 has a couple stable releases and is supposed to be more stable and faster for BGP, I thought I would post some of my configs for version 7 as the config syntax has changed quite a bit.</description></item><item><title>VPS to a coloed server, my homelab journey - Part 1</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-11-04_vps-to-a-coloed-server-my-homelab-journey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 21:01:45 +0000</pubDate><author>Guy Evans</author><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-11-04_vps-to-a-coloed-server-my-homelab-journey/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">
