## TL;DR 

I’m a techie. No doubt about it. I’m into anything to do with computers, electronics and mechanics.

### My life in business ...

I was actually quite far down the road of becoming an accountant. But, once I did some internships with accountants, I knew numbers weren’t my thing.

In the end, I decided to start my own business specialising in IT solutions, looking after small companies. I remember the thrill of getting my first client, followed shortly afterwards by the great reaction I got from the work I did for them.

Some years and a few jobs later, I'm now a systems administrators for a french IT engineering company.

I really enjoy the variety of the work with IT. Technology is great, but it does need handholding. And I don’t know from one day to the next, which hand I’ll have to hold. Also, the industry is ever evolving. You have to learn constantly just to keep up with all the different technologies. It’s challenging, but rewarding.

### Outside of work…

I enjoy building and learning about things. Not just computers and websites. I’ve built all sorts, even 50cc motorbike engines. That’s probably a result of my childhood, when I developed a fascination with taking things apart—not in the bad, destructive way, but to learn how something worked. My parents didn’t always see it that way, of course…

### Best place on Earth…

Where I live currently—the south of France. There aren’t many places where you can live 30 minutes from the sea and the ski slopes.
