## Email
Question: What is one service on the internet that we use regularly and has become part of our day to day? **EMAIL**

Chances are that is you use a computer, you have at the very leat ine email address, some people have more that one (I've lost count of how many I have). That brings me to a firm belief of mine: if you work in IT in _any_ shape or form, your email should be your own, with your own domain name _(hello@evans.fr for example)_ instead of using @gmail.com @outlook.com or @aol.com _(that's an old one)_ or any other provider.

## Why (self-host)
I for one have used to host all of my email addresses on Google Apps _(now called Google Workspace)_. It was simple point the right mx records to their servers and boom your own email domain.

Many other providers also let you do this but where google was clever, is that their service had a great free tier (as in free beer) until they decided to pull the rug out from under us all and sunsetted the free tier. (Another reason people may self-host their email is having full control over the service and not sharing any data with the FAANG companies)

That got me thinking, why not host my own email someday. So to as with a lot of my research starts I go to Reddit.com and the general consensus is: Why bother. But still I continue my research and decide to continue. Afterall the best way to learn is to do it. How hard can it be?

_but first, we need coffee..._
