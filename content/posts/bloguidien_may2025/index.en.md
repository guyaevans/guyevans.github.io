## Writers block and a discovery

I'm always one to struggle with writers block which means this blog usually gets a single post every couple of months. 

But I found a neat idea on [Bacardi55's Web Cave](https://bacardi55.io/), Bloguidien is a website created by two French bloggers, where a new writing prompt is posted every day. It’s designed to be a daily writing challenge—but between a busy schedule and some prompts that don’t really call for long-form responses, that pace doesn’t quite work for me.

So instead, I’ve decided to take a more relaxed approach: each month *(I will try but no promises)*, I’ll pick a few prompts that resonate with me and share my answers in a monthly round-up. I’m hoping this will encourage me to write more regularly—and give you a little window into my thoughts, passions, and favourite things in life.

So here goes ...

## May 2025

*These prompts were chosen in May, but they may have originally been posted some time ago.*

### Have you ever had a job that was completely different to your current one?

Yes-Three actually before working in IT. 
My first real job I worked as pizza delivery boy in my home-town when I was a teenager. Later on in a fast food kitchen as a temp chef which I become permanent after a month. An assistant accountant, too much maths, too many numbers. Need I say more? 

### What was the last book you enjoyed?

**Nuclear War, A Scenario** - [Annie Jacobsen](https://amzn.to/4kINykX) <br>
Takes you on a minute by minute real world nuclear war scenario. Gripping, sometimes gruesome but very eye-opening

### What movie do you regret not seeing at the cinema?

There are a couple actually :

* Interstellar *(in IMAX)*
* Raiders of the Lost Ark
* Oppenheimer *(in IMAX, I went to see it in a non IMAX equipped cinema and it still blew my mind)*

### What advice would you give to someone starting out in your field?

If you had not caught on yet, I am fortunate to work in a field that I enjoy - IT. Here are some of my thoughts and advice I try to pass on ...

**Always be learning** – In the IT world, things change quickly. New tools, languages, and technologies are always coming out. If you don’t keep learning, it’s easy to fall behind. Try out new things, stay curious, read blogs, watch videos, or take online courses. Even small steps can make a big difference over time. The more you learn, the more valuable and confident you’ll become in your career.

**Be Humble** – In tech, no one knows everything *(I certainly don't)*. Sometimes others will know more than you, and sometimes you’ll be the one with more knowledge or experience. Either way, stay open-minded and respectful. Don’t assume, don’t show off — share your knowledge, listen to others, and be willing to learn. 

**You Will Break Things** – And that’s totally fine. In IT, things go wrong — code breaks, systems crash, configs get messed up. It happens to everyone. There are two types of people: those who have brought down a production system, and those who will. Mistakes are part of the job. What matters is how you respond—own it, fix it, learn from it, and move forward. That’s how real experience is built. *You have got a backup? Right?*
