## Intro
I've always had some form of presence on the internet from young, I remember registering my own domain name aged 13 and building my first website with [Microsoft Frontpage](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and then later on with [Adobe Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver. I later moved on to starting a career in IT and designing websites on Wordpress.

These days I have moved away from Wordpress even though it is a great platform for posting a blog and building websites. (Wordpress is said to power 43 % of websites online)[^w3]
