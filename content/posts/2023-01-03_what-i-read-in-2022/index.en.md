Younger I used to read a log, but as I got older I left the books alone. That was until last year when I bought an Amazon Kindle (Yes I know, I could have got an open ereader but thats another conversation). So here is five books I read and enjoyed in 2022

### Sandworm - Andy Greenburg

### Countdown to Zero Day - Kim Zetter

###  Freezing Order - Bill Browder

### Red Notice - Bill Browder

### We Are Bellingcat - Eliot Higgins
