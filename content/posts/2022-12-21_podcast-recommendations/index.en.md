I could be described as a passionate podcast listener, whether I'm on public transport, wondering around town, doing some odd jobs around the flat or during a quiet period at work I usually stick on a podcast. Here are some of my recomendations

## IT & Cybersecurity

### Darknet Diaries - Jack Rhysider

Host Jack takes you on journeys about hackers,breaches, shadow government activity and cybercrime. Jack is a great story teller and his episodes are extremely well written and researched, sound design is also on point.

Risky Business is a weekly podcast that features mostly IT & security news and great in-depth commentary from security industry experts. Hosted by journalist Patrick Grey it is always worth a listen.

Geoff White and Jean Lee take you on the story of "Almost the Perfect Crime". Starts with a hacking ring and an attempt to steal a billion dollars. Investigators point to North Korea. Again another podcast that is well researched and written.
