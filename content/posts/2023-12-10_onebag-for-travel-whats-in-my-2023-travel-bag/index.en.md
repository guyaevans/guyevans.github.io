## Too many bags
I am a fan of traveling, although I haven't been able to travel much since the birth of the little one but I digress. 

Back to Onebag travel: Many of us have dealt with the hassle of managing multiple, often large bags while traveling. How often have you arrived at a destination before being able to check in to your accommodation? In such cases, I usually start exploring the destination, but the challenge is dealing with large bags. Ideally, you can either A) leave your bags at your accommodation, B) find a bag storage location, or C) wait until you can check in.

## Onebag Travel?
But what if I told you there is another way? Well there is ... get rid of all but one bag. 

Onebag travel, also known as one-bagging, is a minimalist approach to travel that involves packing and traveling with only a single piece of luggage, typically a carry-on-sized backpack or suitcase. The goal is to simplify the travel experience by minimizing the amount of belongings one carries, focusing on essential items, and avoiding the need for multiple bags or checked luggage.
### Why Onebag Travel?
Now we know what Onebag travel is, here a just a few upsides:

Cost Savings: Many airlines charge fees for checked baggage. By adhering to carry-on limits, onebag travelers can avoid these fees, contributing to cost savings.

Time Savings: Without the need to check or retrieve multiple bags, onebag travelers can move through airports more quickly, potentially reducing travel time.

Flexibility: Onebag travel encourages a mindset of simplicity. Travelers learn to prioritize essentials, making it easier to adapt to different situations and environments.

## The Bag

Okay so now we know about onebag travel and some of its advantages, we need to choose a bag. I'll spare you most of my research as everyone has different criterias. Here are mine:

The bag:
* be cheap - no more than 100 Euros
* __MUST__ fit in most airline carry-on requirements
* fit a 4 days worth of clothes minimum
* carry a laptop if needed
* be comfy

### So research time I guess?

I started my research on reddit (as I usually do) and quicly stumbled on a goldmine; [r/onebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/), a reddit community dedicated to onebagging.

After hours of browsing a bag cought my eye - The Decathlon NH500 Escape Rolltop which checked most of my requirements:

* Cheap - 49 Euros in Store
* fits plenty
* can carry a laptop and tablet
* _bonus_: designed by Decathlon, a french company :fr: and available in their stores

After some browsing I actually bought mine on Vinted for 35 Euros so a win win I guess.
