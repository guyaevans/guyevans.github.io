I could be described as a passionate podcast listener, whether I'm on public transport, wondering around town, doing some odd jobs around the flat or during a quiet period at work I usually stick on a podcast. Here are some of my recomendations

Another Podcast about a crypto scam. Gerald Cotten, the founder of Canada's biggest Bitcoin exchange died under mysterious circumstances during a honeymoon trip to India in 2018.

His customers were told that the $215 million they'd deposited on the exchange was lost forever — because Gerry had forgotten to leave behind his passwords.

However quite a lot of people don't believe that he's dead.
