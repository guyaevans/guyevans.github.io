            </div><p>I could be described as a passionate podcast listener, whether I&rsquo;m on public transport, wondering around town, doing some odd jobs around the flat or during a quiet period at work I usually stick on a podcast. Here are some of my recomendations</p>
<h2 id="it--cybersecurity" class="headerLink">

<p>Host Jack takes you on journeys about hackers,breaches, shadow government activity and cybercrime. Jack is a great story teller and his episodes are extremely well written and researched, sound design is also on point.</p>
