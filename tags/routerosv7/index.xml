&lt;/div>So I know a couple people who run their ASNs on Mikrotik routers (running RouterOS) as their hardware is cheap and easy to find. That includes me, I run BGP on their CHR image to announce my own ASN and IP v4 and V6 subnets. RouterOS CHR which is an image of RouterOS that you can run on your own hardware.
You would prevously use RouterOS version 6, but now version 7 has a couple stable releases and is supposed to be more stable and faster for BGP, I thought I would post some of my configs for version 7 as the config syntax has changed quite a bit.</description></item></channel></rss>
