&lt;p>How do you secure your public facing services ? The answer usually is in layers. One layer I use is the firewall on my Mikrotik router that sits in front of all my selfhosted services. Another layer I use is Crowdsec which is an IDS/IPS that you can selfhost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The road to 10 Gbps internet - Mikrotik CHR Strangeness</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2024-05-06_the-road-to-10-gbps-internet-mikrotik-chr-strangeness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 22:40:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2024-05-06_the-road-to-10-gbps-internet-mikrotik-chr-strangeness/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-it-started" class="headerLink">

Something I have never really used its full potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Today that changed&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(sort of).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Milkywan has a group chat on telegram where we talk about tech and other things between members. One of the guys there was looking for someone with a Mikrotik router “on-net” to run some bandwidth tests.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BGP IPv4 Config on Mikrotik RouterOSv7</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-11-13_bgp-ipv4-config-on-mikrotik-routerosv7/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-11-13_bgp-ipv4-config-on-mikrotik-routerosv7/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I know a couple people who run their ASNs on Mikrotik routers (running RouterOS) as their hardware is cheap and easy to find. That includes me, I run BGP on their CHR image to announce my own ASN and IP v4 and V6 subnets. RouterOS CHR which is an image of RouterOS that you can run on your own hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You would prevously use RouterOS version 6, but now version 7 has a couple stable releases and is supposed to be more stable and faster for BGP, I thought I would post some of my configs for version 7 as the config syntax has changed quite a bit. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on IPv4 but IPv6 is pretty much the same.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
