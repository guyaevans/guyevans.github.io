&lt;p>How do you secure your public facing services ? The answer usually is in layers. One layer I use is the firewall on my Mikrotik router that sits in front of all my selfhosted services. Another layer I use is Crowdsec which is an IDS/IPS that you can selfhost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The road to 10 Gbps internet - Mikrotik CHR Strangeness</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2024-05-06_the-road-to-10-gbps-internet-mikrotik-chr-strangeness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 22:40:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2024-05-06_the-road-to-10-gbps-internet-mikrotik-chr-strangeness/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-it-started" class="headerLink">

Something I have never really used its full potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Today that changed&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(sort of).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Milkywan has a group chat on telegram where we talk about tech and other things between members. One of the guys there was looking for someone with a Mikrotik router “on-net” to run some bandwidth tests.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A look at Caddy - A simple and fast web server</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2023-04-23_a-look-at-caddy-a-simple-and-fast-web-server/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 09:19:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2023-04-23_a-look-at-caddy-a-simple-and-fast-web-server/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all used Apache and NGNIX when we have had to host a website and they are fin but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve never gotten along with their config. And that is what bought me to Caddy. Lets take a look at what Caddy has to offer.</description></item><item><title>VPS to a coloed server, my homelab journey - Part 2</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-12-24_vps-to-a-coloed-server-my-homelab-journey-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 16:04:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-12-24_vps-to-a-coloed-server-my-homelab-journey-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="after-the-virtual-private-servers" class="headerLink">
 &lt;a href="#after-the-virtual-private-servers" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'After the Virtual Private Servers'">&lt;/a>After the Virtual Private Servers&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After loosing one of my virtual private servers along with the data in the &lt;em>&amp;lsquo;The Great Fire of OVH&lt;/em> &amp;#x1f525;&amp;rsquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> (Yes I know I should have had backups of that VPS&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>), I thought why not setup a Proxmox&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Cluster&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> on a couple dedicated servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I went ahead and found &lt;a href="https://oneprovider.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneProvider.com&lt;/a> where you can rent dedicated servers for cheap, their cheap hardware is old and the connectivity is ok but you cannot beat there pricing (Server with an Intel Atom C2750, 16 Gb Ram, 1Tb Hard drive and 1Gb of &amp;lsquo;unlimited&amp;rsquo; bandwidth was €14 per server/month at the time). That went great for a couple of months but I kept getting frustrated with not having full control over the hardware and my growing interest for BGP&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and how the internet is really just a bunch of (small) inter connected networks. After some trial and error I decided I should review my home-lab goals and re-think my shopping list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VPS to a coloed server, my homelab journey - Part 1</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-11-04_vps-to-a-coloed-server-my-homelab-journey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 21:01:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-11-04_vps-to-a-coloed-server-my-homelab-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a young child I always had an interest in computers and tech, little did I know that it would foundation for my carear path that I have chosen today.&lt;/p>
