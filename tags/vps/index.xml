            </div><h2 id="after-the-virtual-private-servers" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#after-the-virtual-private-servers" class="header-mark"></a>After the Virtual Private Servers</h2><p>After loosing one of my virtual private servers along with the data in the <em>&lsquo;The Great Fire of OVH</em> &#x1f525;&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (Yes I know I should have had backups of that VPS<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>), I thought why not setup a Proxmox<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Cluster<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> on a couple dedicated servers.</p>
<p>So I went ahead and found <a href="https://oneprovider.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneProvider.com</a> where you can rent dedicated servers for cheap, their cheap hardware is old and the connectivity is ok but you cannot beat there pricing (Server with an Intel Atom C2750, 16 Gb Ram, 1Tb Hard drive and 1Gb of &lsquo;unlimited&rsquo; bandwidth was €14 per server/month at the time). That went great for a couple of months but I kept getting frustrated with not having full control over the hardware and my growing interest for BGP<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and how the internet is really just a bunch of (small) inter connected networks. After some trial and error I decided I should review my home-lab goals and re-think my shopping list.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="the-shopping-list" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-shopping-list" class="header-mark"></a>The Shopping List</h2><p>So what did I want?</p>
<ul>
<li>My own (recent-ish) hardware</li>
<li>A Decent Host for my hardware (Colocation Provider)</li>
<li>BGP transit connection with my own leased /24 block of IPs</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 Gb connection to the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>I now had a plan and a decent shopping list, although we didn&rsquo;t talk about budget. Lets just say around €700 for the hardware and another €100-120 per month for the hosting.</p>
<h3 id="a-decent-host-for-my-hardware" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#a-decent-host-for-my-hardware" class="header-mark"></a>A Decent Host for my hardware</h3><p>I first found a great host for my hardware while browsing <a href="https://lafibre.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaFibre.info</a> a french forum about fiber to the home and IT in general. The host I chose is <a href="https://milkywan.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MilkyWan</em></a>, they are a small not for profit internet service provider run by a small passionate team.</p>
<p>They specialise in providing Virtual Servers, Hosting, ADSL and Fiber Internet. They also have multiple points of presence in french datacenters where they can host hardware and provide BGP transit. They also have a great community on telegram.</p>
<p>Cost : €75 for 1U Server Housing, Power and Network Connection.</p>
<p>Bonus: They can provide a 10Gb connection to the internet.</p>
<p><em>Did I mention they have a great community, being charity run means that they hold annual meeting and have the best interests of their members at heart. Since the end of 2022 I am also an elected representative of the members to the charity comity</em></p>
<h3 id="my-own-recent-ish-hardware" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#my-own-recent-ish-hardware" class="header-mark"></a>My own (recent-ish) hardware</h3><p>Now I had found somewhere for my hardware, I actually needed some hardware. I found what I needed in <a href="https://www.bargainhardware.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BargainHardware.co.uk</a>, they specialise in secondhand enterprise hardware and have great prices.</p>
<p>Here is the server I settled on:</p>
<p><strong>Dell Poweredge R620</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 x Intel Xeon E5-2660 V2 2.20Ghz Ten Core CPUs</li>
<li>96 Gb of DDR3 RAM</li>
<li>2 x 240 Gb Crucial SSDs for the boot drives (They will be in Raid 1 to provide redundancy in case of a drive failure)</li>
<li>6 x 900 Gb SAS Hard drives for the datadrives to give us a total of 5Tb usable space (This will be the main storage pool and will be in a ZFS pool to provide redundancy in case of a drive failure)</li>
<li>1 x Dell BCM57800S Quad Port - 1GbE, 10GbE SFP+, RJ45 network card</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost: €700 including shipping to france.</p>
<p>Not too old to be inefficient to run and not too recent that it breaks the bank. This should provide me with plenty of horsepower to multiple virtual machines.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#putting-it-all-together" class="header-mark"></a>Putting it all together</h2><p>After ordering the server and ordering the hosting, all I had to do is setup <a href="https://www.proxmox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proxmox</a>  and then ship my brand new server to <em>Milkywan</em> and they racked it for me in their datacenter.</p>
<p>I now have my own hardware with a 10G connection in a french datacenter. You may notice in the image of the speedtest below that my name appears as the ISP, that&rsquo;s because I have effectively become my own ISP as I provide my server with internet via my own ASN (<a href="https://bgp.he.net/AS211486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AS211486</a>) and IPs. (Cloudflare has a great explainer on BGP<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>)</p>
<p>My server hosts most of my &lsquo;homelab&rsquo; including parts of this website, like the comment system and the statistics. I also have a small setup at home with a NAS and a microserver which I will probably write another post about that.</p>
<p><figure><img  loading="lazy" src='https://www.speedtest.net/result/c/bca2e66f-818f-413c-9ac0-01f538aaf561.png'   alt="10G Proof"  ><figcaption class="image-caption">Almost 10G but that's another story</figcaption>
</figure></p>
<p>My server is the last machine in the rack on the header image of this post. Have you wanted or have setup your own homelab? Share your thoughts below.</p>

            </div><p>As a young child I always had an interest in computers and tech, little did I know that it would foundation for my carear path that I have chosen today.</p>
<p>So where I am retracing my steps of how I ended up with a server colocated in a datacenter that made me the sys and net admin I am today</p>
<h2 id="how-i-started" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#how-i-started" class="header-mark"></a>How I Started</h2><p>Age 12 - I had built my own website (but thats a story for another post.)</p>
<p>At age 19, I had already learnt about running small business networks and managed a couple for family businesses and friends but I had no equipmenent or anything to learn and try things on. Thats when I learnt what a Homelab is.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-homelab" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#what-is-a-homelab" class="header-mark"></a>What is a Homelab?</h3><p>I can hear you in the back &hellip; What is a homelab?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A homelab, in the simplest terms is a sandbox that you can learn and play with new or unfamiliar technologies.  They can be as simple as a set of VM’s on an old PC or laptop to as complex whole network with it&rsquo;s own ASN (we will get to that, eventually &hellip;)</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="virtual-private-servers-with-ovh" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#virtual-private-servers-with-ovh" class="header-mark"></a>Virtual Private Servers with OVH</h3><h4 id="vps-number-1-the-website" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#vps-number-1-the-website" class="header-mark"></a>VPS Number 1: The website</h4><p>After doing some research I new two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What service I wanted to Hhst: my website</li>
<li>The rough location I wanted it hosted in: France</li>
</ol>
<p>A bit more research later I found <a href="https://ovh.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OVH</a>, they are a web host based in france. OVH offered and still do cheap and very good Virtual Private Servers. I went and chose a 1vCore and 512 Mb RAM server to run my website that was based on Wordpress<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This VPS<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> eventually ended up hosting the website for EvansMedia, my IT and Web services company until the 10th March 2021 and what I will call <em>&lsquo;The Great Fire of OVH</em> &#x1f525;&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, where their four Strasbourg Datacenters went up in smoke (literally, more on that later).</p>
<h4 id="vps-number-2-the-storage-server" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#vps-number-2-the-storage-server" class="header-mark"></a>VPS Number 2: The storage server</h4><p>THe next VPS<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> came around when I was looking to sync my files acroos my many devices, for privacy reasons I didn&rsquo;y want to use Google Drive or an equivalent. I ended up on Owncloud and then moved to Nextcloud which is what I still use today. Nextcloud is functionally similar to Dropbox, Office 365 or Google Drive, It can be hosted in the cloud or on your own server.</p>
<p>Next time: I&rsquo;ll go over what moved me to a dedicated server and soon after my own hardware colo rack with a charity run ISP</p>
