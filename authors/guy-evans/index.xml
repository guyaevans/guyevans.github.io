&lt;p>How do you secure your public facing services ? The answer usually is in layers. One layer I use is the firewall on my Mikrotik router that sits in front of all my selfhosted services. Another layer I use is Crowdsec which is an IDS/IPS that you can selfhost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo, Caddy and Github actions to publish my website</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2024-10-11_publishing-my-website-with-hugo-caddy-and-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 15:28:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2024-10-11_publishing-my-website-with-hugo-caddy-and-github-actions/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had some form of presence on the internet from a young age, I remember registering my own domain name aged 13 and building my first website with &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Frontpage&lt;/a> and then later on with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Dreamweaver&lt;/a>. I later moved on to starting a career in IT and designing websites some websites with &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordpress.&lt;/a>.

Great, another thing to &amp;lsquo;smartify&amp;rsquo; with Home Assistant. But Daikin&amp;rsquo;s Wifi modules are way to expensive and cloud dependent.</description></item><item><title>The road to 10 Gbps internet - Mikrotik CHR Strangeness</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2024-05-06_the-road-to-10-gbps-internet-mikrotik-chr-strangeness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 22:40:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2024-05-06_the-road-to-10-gbps-internet-mikrotik-chr-strangeness/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-it-started" class="headerLink">

&lt;p>Back to Onebag travel: Many of us have dealt with the hassle of managing multiple, often large bags while travelling. How often have you arrived at a destination before being able to check in to your accommodation? In such cases, I usually start exploring the destination, but the challenge is dealing with large bags. Ideally, you can either A) leave your bags at your accommodation, B) find a bag storage location, or C) wait until you can check in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Apps I use in 2023</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2023-11-26_what-apps-i-use-in-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 20:54:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2023-11-26_what-apps-i-use-in-2023/</guid><description>Do you use a lot of different apps during your day?

 &lt;a href="#after-the-virtual-private-servers" class="header-mark" aria-label="Header mark for 'After the Virtual Private Servers'">&lt;/a>After the Virtual Private Servers&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After loosing one of my virtual private servers along with the data in the &lt;em>&amp;lsquo;The Great Fire of OVH&lt;/em> &amp;#x1f525;&amp;rsquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> (Yes I know I should have had backups of that VPS&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>), I thought why not setup a Proxmox&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Cluster&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> on a couple dedicated servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I went ahead and found &lt;a href="https://oneprovider.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneProvider.com&lt;/a> where you can rent dedicated servers for cheap, their cheap hardware is old and the connectivity is ok but you cannot beat there pricing (Server with an Intel Atom C2750, 16 Gb Ram, 1Tb Hard drive and 1Gb of &amp;lsquo;unlimited&amp;rsquo; bandwidth was €14 per server/month at the time). That went great for a couple of months but I kept getting frustrated with not having full control over the hardware and my growing interest for BGP&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and how the internet is really just a bunch of (small) inter connected networks.

That includes me, I run BGP on their CHR image to announce my own ASN and IP v4 and V6 subnets. RouterOS CHR which is an image of RouterOS that you can run on your own hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You would prevously use RouterOS version 6, but now version 7 has a couple stable releases and is supposed to be more stable and faster for BGP, I thought I would post some of my configs for version 7 as the config syntax has changed quite a bit. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on IPv4 but IPv6 is pretty much the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VPS to a coloed server, my homelab journey - Part 1</title><link>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-11-04_vps-to-a-coloed-server-my-homelab-journey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 21:01:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guy-evans.com/posts/2022-11-04_vps-to-a-coloed-server-my-homelab-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a young child I always had an interest in computers and tech, little did I know that it would foundation for my carear path that I have chosen today.&lt;/p>
