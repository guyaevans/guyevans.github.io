But I found a neat idea on Bacardi55’s Web Cave, Bloguidien is a website created by two French bloggers, where a new writing prompt is posted every day. It’s designed to be a daily writing challenge—but between a busy schedule and some prompts that don’t really call for long-form responses, that pace doesn’t quite work for me. So instead, I’ve decided to take a more relaxed approach: each month (I will try but no promises), I’ll pick a few prompts that resonate with me and share my answers in a monthly round-up. I’m hoping this will encourage me to write more regularly—and give you a little window into my thoughts, passions, and favourite things in life.

Here are some of my thoughts and advice I try to pass on … Always be learning – In the IT world, things change quickly. New tools, languages, and technologies are always coming out. If you don’t keep learning, it’s easy to fall behind. Try out new things, stay curious, read blogs, watch videos, or take online courses. Even small steps can make a big difference over time. The more you learn, the more valuable and confident you’ll become in your career. Be Humble – In tech, no one knows everything (I certainly don’t). Sometimes others will know more than you, and sometimes you’ll be the one with more knowledge or experience. Either way, stay open-minded and respectful. Don’t assume, don’t show off — share your knowledge, listen to others, and be willing to learn. You Will Break Things – And that’s totally fine. In IT, things go wrong — code breaks, systems crash, configs get messed up. It happens to everyone. There are two types of people: those who have brought down a production system, and those who will. Mistakes are part of the job. What matters is how you respond—own it, fix it, learn from it, and move forward. That’s how real experience is built. You have got a backup? Right?

The answer usually is in layers. One layer I use is the firewall on my Mirotik router that sits in front of all my selfhosted services. Another layer I use is Crowdsec which is an IDS/IPS that you can selfhost and is augmented by community blocklists. Today we will be setting both up so that the Mikrotik can use Crowdsec’s blocklists to secure my homelab network directly at the entrance. CrowdSec is an open-source, collaborative security solution designed to detect and mitigate threats at scale. It functions as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) by analyzing logs from various sources (such as firewalls, servers, and applications) to identify suspicious behavior.

For wired networks 802.1x allows us to require authentication at the port level on a supported switch which also allows us to dynamically assign VLANs to the port or connecting device. Imagine a situation where you have a public meeting room equipped with accessible Ethernet ports, and you want to ensure secure access to those ports. In such a scenario, you have two options to consider: The first option is to disable any unused ports. While this approach provides some level of security, it comes with a drawback. What if someone needs to use the port? In that case, you would have to manually log in to the switch, enable the port temporarily, and then disable it again once it’s no longer in use. This process can be quite cumbersome and timewaster for IT staff. The second and more efficient option is to implement 802.1X. This standard offers a superior solution by keeping the ports active at all times. With 802.1X, when a company device is plugged into the port, it will automatically gain access to the company network on the assigned VLAN. However, if an unknown device is connected, it will be assigned to a VLAN of your choice, typically a public network with only internet access. This segregation ensures that unauthorized devices cannot access the company network. The best part is that you no longer need to manually enable and disable ports whenever access is required.
